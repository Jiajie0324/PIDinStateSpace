PID in State Space Form
=======================
This was something I was wondering if you could do and when I searched there
was one guy who apparently has worked out the math.

### Derivation
##### PIDvsSS.{pdf,tex}
The full derivation and outputs from the example system
##### handout.{pdf,tex}
A summary of the important equation
##### PIDvsSS with Additional Setpoint Term.{pdf,tex}
A version with closer to the original work the other guy did
##### OriginalPaper/paper.html
A copy of the original paper but with the images showing correctly. At the
moment I downloaded it, his plots wouldn't show up.

### Examples
##### example.m
Run the example in Octave
#### example\_matlab.m
Run the example in Matlab
##### example\_additional\_setpoint.m
Run the example using the state space form closer to the original in the other
guy's paper
